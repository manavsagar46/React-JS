# 🎯 React-JS Learning Journey

Hey there! 👋  
I’m on a mission to learn **React JS** ⚛️ — one component at a time.  
This repo is my playground for experiments, practice code, and mini-projects.

## 🚀 What I’m Learning
- 🧩 Components & JSX  
- 📦 Props & State  
- 🎣 Hooks (useState, useEffect...)  
- 🌐 Routing  
- 📝 Forms & Events
